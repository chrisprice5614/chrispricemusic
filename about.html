            <p>Coming from a background in computer science and mathamatics, Chris Price would spend his free time building synthesizers and getting a deeper meaning of how sound and music works. With a fascination of spectral music, Chris would compose with the idea of how the overall sound would be in the music. Chris has written for many ensembles all across the globe, and holds the title of composing the unofficial Antartica anthem of Palmer Station. With several elite marching ensembles under his belt, including 2 Drum Corps International groups, Price can write very memorable music.</p>
