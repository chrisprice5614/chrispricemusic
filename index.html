Chris Price Music got the wonderful opportunity to write and arrange show for their inagural season. Original music was used, with the ballad being an arrangement of "The Promise of Living" by Aaron Copland. Our Visual Designer, Austin Moldenhaur, created the drill for the show.<br>On top of writing the show music, Chris Price Music has gotten the chance to write parade style arrangements, letting the Gems express their musicality through popular music.</p>
