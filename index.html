                <h1>New For Late 2024</h1>
                <p>Getting ready for a christmas concert? Check out this new arrangement of Sleigh Ride by Leroy Anderson for Jazz Band! Designing next year's marching band show? Take a look at Yggdrasil! Pep band season is also coming up, so that means new music for the basketball games! Check out these arrangements of new popular songs!</p>

                <h3>Yggdrasil [Marching Band Show]</h3>
                <iframe width="100%" height="auto" style="padding-bottom: 0;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AdGkVGaCErw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen class="youtube-video"></iframe>
                <p>Yggdrasil is the Norse mythological tree that encompasses the world, connecting Earth, Heaven and Hell. This marching band show explores the concept of the sacred tree, having music that points towards Norse Mythology. Tons of unique and memorable sounds are stitched throughout the show, giving the audience an interesting spectacle to witness. Each movement has a very unique identity to it, giving the performers several opportunities to display their array of talents. The show uses musical selections including Mykonos by Fleet Foxes, Kingsfold, and old Norse folk melodies.</p>

                <h3>Sleigh Ride [Jazz Band]</h3>
                <iframe width="100%" height="auto" style="padding-bottom: 0;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cscTrCBilvA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen class="youtube-video"></iframe>
                <p>As an exploration of the original piece by Leroy Anderson, this arrangement of Sleigh Ride for big band explores the possibilities of tonal and rhythmic variations of the original lines. The though process behind this arrangement was to take the listeners and performers through different scenes, discovering new viewpoints where the original melodies could be heard. Unique vantage points are written to create a fresh take on this beloved holiday classic.</p>

                <h3>APT - Rosé & Bruno Mars</h3>
                <iframe width="100%" height="auto" style="padding-bottom: 0;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eFt4eLVcvZ0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen class="youtube-video"></iframe>
                <p>APT. is a fun new energetic tune by Rosé & Bruno Mars. The music features upbeat catchy repeating phrases that keep the song interesting and driving forward. I modeled this arrangement after classics, such as Land of 1000 dances to make it fun to listen to and to play!</p>

                <h3>Taste - Sabrina Carpenter</h3>
                <iframe width="100%" height="auto" style="padding-bottom: 0;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gnFBUFzWkus" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen class="youtube-video"></iframe>
                <p>Taste came out earlier this summer. I first heard it while at the gym, and I really enjoyed how all the parts and sounds came together. It's an energetic pop rock song that has lots of great melodies. It took me a while to put together an arrangement of it, just because I wasn't sure how to have the big picture of it put together. Eventually, I drafted a plan on how to make an effective marching band arrangement of this song, and then turned it into a full arrangement!</p>
