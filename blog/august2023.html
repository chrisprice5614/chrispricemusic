            <p>I'm still in awe at what we got to accomplish over this summer. Chris Price Music had the wonderful opportunity to work with lots of amazing musicians to put together an incredible inagural show for the Boise Gems Drum and Bugle Corps. Every member of Chris Price Music has always wanted to design and write for a drum corps and now that dream has been met. The Gems got to perform "Esto Perpetua" in Caldwell ID, Kennewick WA, Boise ID, and Salt Lake City UT. To say this experience is surreal is a huge understatement.</p>

            <p>What amazes me most is how quickly the show was put on the field. Although the ballad had to be cut due to copyright issues, we were still able to put together an amazing show in only one week. The drill, written by our very own, Austin Moldenhaur, was challenging for the performers, but still fun and achievable. The brass and overall music design was written by our Chris Price, giving the performers fun music that let them grow as musicians. The front ensemble written by Josh Russell, and battery by Brendan Williams and Casey O'Brain, really challenged the musicians and let them taste music that's brand new.</p>

            <p>This video below, made by Chris Price, shows the journey and experience of what it was like to write for a Drum and Bugle Corps. Chris Price music is excited to continue writing for the Gems. Esto Perpetua.</p>
